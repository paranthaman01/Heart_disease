# Heart_disease
Heart Disease risk prediction using Machine learning
 It is also a machine learning algorithm to predict the heart disease.
  Datasets are extracted. 
 Various preprocessing actions are performed. 
 The pre-processed data are visualized. 
 This predicting model uses python tools to make analysis.
  The accuracy of heart disease is predicted. 
Description
In this modern world, various kinds of diseases are gradually increasing. Especially heart diseases are a critical thing for human beings. It causes more risk for people life that is variation in blood pressure, sugar, pulse rate etc. The cardiovascular diseases may cause heart failure like more diseases in human heart that is heart attack, stroke and even sudden cardiac arrest. We can detect the heart diseases with different medical test and other factors. I predict the heart diseases using machine learning algorithm, in this process feed the heart related data into the machine learning algorithm, specifically in random forest algorithm. This algorithm provides more accuracy compare with other algorithm, for predict heart disease using heart disease dataset.
Getting Started
Dependencies
•	Jupyter Notebook / Google colab
•	Python Libraries like pandas, numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn etc…
•	Windows 10
Installing
•	Using Anaconda:
Install Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution, which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. To install Anaconda, go through How to install Anaconda on windows? and follow the instructions provided.
•	Using PIP:

Installing Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda:
Anaconda is an open-source software that contains Jupyter, spyder, etc that are used for large data processing, data analytics, heavy scientific computing. Anaconda works for R and python programming language. Spyder(sub-application of Anaconda) is used for python. Opencv for python will work in spyder. Package versions are managed by the package management system called conda.
